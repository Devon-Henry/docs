## Best Practices for RAG Optimization

RAG technology uses similarity matching to find relevant content. Follow these guidelines for optimal results:

### ✅ Good Practice

Write content the way users might ask about it:

```markdown
**File: lucky-number.md**
Contoso's lucky number is 42. This number was chosen as the company's 
official lucky number during the founding ceremony in 2020.
```

**User question:** "What is Contoso's lucky number?"  
**Result:** High similarity score ✅ - AI finds and uses this context effectively.

### ❌ Poor Practice

Avoid bare facts without context:

```markdown
**File: lucky-number.md**
42
```

**User question:** "What is Contoso's lucky number?"  
**Result:** Low similarity score ❌ - AI may not retrieve this as relevant context.

### Writing Tips
