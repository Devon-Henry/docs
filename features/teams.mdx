# Teams

Teams house projects, so you must start your Ragou journey with a team. Teams provide the foundation for organizing your work and managing access to your projects and data.

![Teams Overview](/images/teams.jpeg)

## Getting Started with Teams

Every Ragou workspace begins with creating a team. Teams serve as the organizational unit that contains all your projects, data, and collaborative work.

## Team Management

### Creating a Team

To create a new team:
1. Navigate to your dashboard
2. Click "Create Team" 
3. Enter your team name and details
4. Set up initial permissions

### Updating Team Display Name

You can easily update your team's display name at any time:
1. Go to Team Settings
2. Click "Edit" icon
3. Update the display name
4. Save your changes

## Team Members and Permissions

Teams use a role-based permission system with three distinct levels:

### Permission Levels

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Owner">
    **Full Control**
    - Manage team settings and billing
    - Add/remove team members
    - Manage all projects within the team
    - Access to all data and monitoring
    - Full administrative privileges
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Contributor">
    **Project Management**
    - Manage data upload and deletion
    - Create and edit projects
    - Access monitoring and analytics
    - Manage forms and responses
    - Cannot manage team billing or members
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Reader">
    **View-Only Access**
    - Read-only access to data and monitoring
    - View forms and responses
    - Edit "mark contacted" status only
    - Cannot upload, delete, or manage projects
    - Limited to viewing permissions
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Important Permission Notes

<Warning>
Currently, there is no support for project-level RBAC (Role-Based Access Control). All permissions are inherited from the team level, so it's crucial to assign the correct permissions to users based on their needs.
</Warning>

## Managing Team Members

### Inviting Members

To invite new members to your team:

1. **Find the User ID**: Ask the person you want to invite for their User ID, which can be found in their profile settings
2. **Send Invitation**: 
   - Go to Team Settings > Members
   - Click "Invite Member"
   - Enter their User ID
   - Select the appropriate permission level (Owner, Contributor, or Reader)
   - Send the invitation

3. **Acceptance Process**: The invited user will:
   - Receive a notification about the invitation
   - Navigate to their "Invites" area in their Teams page
   - Accept the invitation to join the team

### Managing Existing Members

Once members are part of your team, you can:
- Change their permission levels
- Remove members from the team
- View member activity and contributions

## Best Practices

<Tip>
**Permission Assignment Guidelines:**
- Assign Owner roles sparingly - only to users who need full administrative access
- Use Contributor roles for team members who actively work with data and projects
- Reader roles are perfect for stakeholders who need visibility but not editing capabilities
</Tip>

### Team Organization Tips

1. **Start Small**: Begin with a core team and add members as needed
2. **Clear Roles**: Communicate permission levels clearly to all team members
3. **Regular Reviews**: Periodically review team membership and permissions
4. **Billing Awareness**: Remember that only Owners can manage billing, so ensure you have at least one active Owner

## Next Steps

After setting up your team:
1. Create your first project within the team
2. Set up data sources and integrations
3. Configure monitoring and alerts
4. Start collaborating with your team members
