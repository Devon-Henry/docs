# Form Generation

<Note>
  **Basic Tier Feature** - Form generation is available on Basic tier and above (Pro included). Check our [pricing page](https://www.ragou.net/pricing) for more details.
</Note>

Bridge the gap between AI assistance and human support with intelligent form generation that captures leads and ensures no customer query goes unanswered.

## Overview

Forms serve as a crucial **manual fallback and lead generation tool** when AI cannot fully address customer needs. This ensures every customer interaction has a path to resolution, even for complex or niche questions.

## How Forms Work

### When Forms Are Triggered

Forms can be used when:

- **Data doesn't exist** - Information isn't available in your knowledge base
- **Questions are too niche** - Highly specific queries outside general documentation
- **Complex dependencies** - Multi-part questions requiring human expertise
- **AI confidence is low** - When the AI isn't certain about the accuracy of its response

<Info>
  Forms provide a safety net ensuring customers always have a way to get help, even when AI reaches its limits.

## User Experience
