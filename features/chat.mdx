## Chat Modes

Ragou offers two distinct chat modes, each designed for different use cases and audiences.

### Team Chat Mode

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="users" title="Internal Team Access">
    Team chat mode provides access to your team's internal data and documentation. This mode is identified by the **team selector** in the top right of the interface.
    
    <Note>Team chat is internal-only and cannot be accessed publicly by your website visitors.</Note>
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion icon="database" title="Team Data Access">
    When using team chat, you can leverage the RAG system internally for:
    
    - **Project Information**: Access details about your team's projects
    - **Internal Documentation**: Query your team's documentation and knowledge base
    - **Application Support**: Use as a RAG system for internal application documentation
    
    The system displays which document chunk the AI used to generate each answer, providing full transparency and source attribution.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Project Chat Mode

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="flask" title="Testing Playground">
    Project chat serves as an **internal-facing playground** for your public projects. This mode allows you to:
    
    - Test your chat and data setup before going live
    - Verify AI responses and behavior
    - Debug and optimize your project configuration
    
    Like team chat, project chat returns source information showing which documents were used to generate responses.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion icon="eye-slash" title="Source Visibility">
    <Warning>
      Source information is only available in the internal chat interfaces (team and project chat). Public chat components do **not** display source attribution to end users.
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion icon="chart-bar" title="Usage Allowance">
    <Tip>
      Project chat currently does not count against your chat usage allowance, making it ideal for extensive testing and development.
    </Tip>
    
    <Note>
      We reserve the right to change this policy if the endpoint is abused. Use responsibly for legitimate testing purposes.
    </Note>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Switching Between Projects

You can easily switch between different projects while using the chat interface:

1. Locate the **project selector** in the prompt input area
2. Click the dropdown to view available projects
3. Select the desired project to switch context

<Info>
  Switching projects changes the data context and available knowledge base for your chat session.
