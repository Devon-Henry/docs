## Quick Setup

Add Ragou's AI chat to your WordPress website using the built-in Custom HTML blocks.

### Basic WordPress Integration

Follow these steps to add the chat widget to individual pages:

#### Step 1: Navigate to WordPress Admin


First, navigate to your WordPress admin site and log in.

#### Step 2: Visit Your Site

Click your site title in the top left corner of the admin dashboard and select **"Visit Site"**.

<img
  className="block"
  src="/images/wpadmin.png"
  alt="WordPress Admin Dashboard"
/>


#### Step 3: Enter Edit Mode

Click **"Edit Page"** at the top in the toolbar. You'll now be in the WordPress block editor.

<img
  className="block"
  src="/images/edit-site.png"
  alt="Visit Site from WordPress Admin"
/>

#### Step 4: Add Custom HTML Block

<img
  className="block dark:hidden"
  src="/images/custom-html.png"
  alt="Adding Custom HTML Block"
/>

1. Click the **plus (+)** button in the top left
2. Search for **"Custom HTML"**
3. Insert the Custom HTML block

#### Step 5: Insert Widget Code

<img
  className="block dark:hidden"
  src="/images/html-insert.png"
  alt="Inserting HTML Code"
/>

Find the Custom HTML block in your page and insert the following code:

```html
<script src="https://chat-widget-cdn.ragou.workers.dev/app.umd.js"></script>
<chat-widget projectId="your-project-id"></chat-widget>
```

<Warning>
Replace `your-project-id` with your actual Project ID from the [Ragou dashboard](https://app.ragou.net/home/teams/projects).
</Warning>

<Note>
**Important**: This process needs to be repeated for each page on your site where you want the chat widget to appear.
</Note>

## Advanced Integration (Site-Wide)

For a site-wide installation that appears on all pages, use WordPress global widgets:

### Method 1: Theme Customizer

1. Navigate to **WordPress Admin** â†’ **Appearance** â†’ **Customize**
2. Look for widget areas like **Footer**, **Header**, or **Sidebar**
3. Add a **Custom HTML** widget to any globally present widget area
4. Insert the Ragou widget code:

```html
<script src="https://chat-widget-cdn.ragou.workers.dev/app.umd.js"></script>
<chat-widget projectId="your-project-id"></chat-widget>
```

### Method 2: Theme Editor (Advanced Users)

<Warning>
Only attempt this if you're comfortable editing theme files. Always backup your site first.
</Warning>

1. Go to **Appearance** â†’ **Theme Editor**
2. Edit your theme's `footer.php` or `header.php` file
3. Add the widget code before the closing `</body>` tag

## Customized Example

Add branding and customization to match your WordPress theme:

```html
<script src="https://chat-widget-cdn.ragou.workers.dev/app.umd.js"></script>
<chat-widget 
    title="Customer Support"
    projectId="your-project-id"
    color="#8B5CF6"
    icon="ðŸ’¬"
    pulsing="true">
</chat-widget>
```

## Integration Tips

    The Ragou widget works with most WordPress themes and plugins. If you experience conflicts:
    
    - Try placing the code in different locations (header vs footer)
    - Check for JavaScript errors in browser console
    - Test with other plugins temporarily disabled
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion icon="mobile" title="Mobile Responsiveness">
    The widget automatically adapts to mobile screens and works with responsive WordPress themes.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion icon="gear" title="Caching Plugins">
    If using caching plugins (WP Rocket, W3 Total Cache, etc.):
    
    - Clear cache after adding the widget
    - Some plugins may need JavaScript optimization disabled for the widget to work properly
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion icon="shield" title="Security Plugins">
    If using security plugins that block external scripts:
    
    - Whitelist `https://chat-widget-cdn.ragou.workers.dev/`
    - Allow the domain in your security plugin settings
  </Accordion>
